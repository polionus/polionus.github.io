  <h1>Recursive Fill-in-the-Blank Dialogue (RFD)</h1>

  <p>Recursive Fill-in-the-Blank Dialogue (RFD) is a calibration game for deep mutual understanding. Its purpose is to help two people accurately model each other’s inner states and communicate emotional experience with clarity and care—using only structured fill-in-the-blank statements and "Yay"/"Nay" feedback.</p>

  <p>This method helps reduce projection, prevent cross-talking or over-explaining, and build a shared map of each other’s inner experience.</p>

  <p>Only fill-in-the-blanks and “Yay”/“Nay” are allowed. No clarifications, no justifications, no discussion—just the structure. Each person takes turns generating five or more fill-in-the-blank prompts. These should reflect that person’s internal state. The other person attempts to complete each blank honestly, using their current model of the other person’s inner experience. The originator gives feedback only by marking “Yay” or “Nay” next to each answer. The responder then writes their own five or more internal-state-based prompts—in response to what was just explored—and the cycle continues.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <div class="example">
    <p><strong>Person A's fill-in-the-blank statements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When I ask for space, I’m really trying to ______.</li>
      <li>When I cry in front of you, I wish you would ______.</li>
      <li>I often feel distant from you when you ______.</li>
      <li>I feel most supported when you respond by ______.</li>
      <li>One thing I’m afraid you assume about me is ______.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Person B’s completions and Person A’s feedback:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>…regulate my emotions before re-connecting. → Yay</li>
      <li>…stay present quietly, not fix anything. → Yay</li>
      <li>…change the subject to something logistical. → Yay</li>
      <li>…acknowledging my emotions without minimizing them. → Yay</li>
      <li>…that I’m too much or overreacting. → Nay</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Person B’s fill-in-the-blank statements (based on their inner experience in response):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When I get a Nay from you, I start to believe that I’m ______.</li>
      <li>When you ask for space, I feel like I’m being ______.</li>
      <li>I feel hurt when I try to guess your needs and get it ______.</li>
      <li>When I hear silence from you, I usually tell myself that you’re feeling ______.</li>
      <li>When I do get a Yay from you, I feel more ______.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Person A’s completions and Person B’s feedback:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>…failing to understand or connect with you. → Yay</li>
      <li>…pushed away or rejected. → Yay</li>
      <li>…totally wrong and unhelpful. → Yay</li>
      <li>…frustrated or disappointed. → Nay</li>
      <li>…encouraged and aligned. → Yay</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>This method works best as a regular practice, where each round builds a tighter loop of empathy and calibration. Because no commentary is allowed, the blanks must carry the full emotional weight—and that sharpens clarity and care.</p>
